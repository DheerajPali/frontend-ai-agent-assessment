3. **TypeScript Integration**: Comprehensive type definitions for API responses and component state
4. **Responsive Grid Layout**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for optimal desktop/mobile experience

## üîß API Integration

The frontend expects the following backend endpoints:

```typescript
// Fetch search history
GET /api/search-queries
Response: SearchQuery[]

// Submit new search
POST /api/search-query
Body: { query: string }
Response: SearchQuery

// Future endpoint for article details
GET /api/articles/:id
Response: ArticleContent
```

### Data Models

```typescript
interface SearchQuery {
  id: number

## ü§ñ AI Assistant Strategy & Prompt Engineering

### Prompt Engineering Approach

Throughout this project, I employed strategic prompt engineering techniques to maximize productivity while maintaining code ownership and quality:

#### 1. **Contextual Specificity**
Instead of generic requests, I provided rich context:
```
‚ùå Poor: "Create a React component"
‚úÖ Effective: "Create a React TypeScript component for displaying search results with AI summaries, article links, and user feedback. It should integrate with these existing API endpoints: /api/search-queries (GET) and /api/search-query (POST). Use Tailwind for styling with a dark theme."
```

#### 2. **Iterative Refinement**
I used a progressive enhancement approach:
- **Initial Prompt**: Basic functionality structure
- **Follow-up Prompts**: "Add error handling", "Make it responsive", "Add TypeScript interfaces"
- **Refinement**: "Update the feedback system to use emoji instead of icons that aren't available"

#### 3. **Constraint-Driven Prompts**
Specified technical constraints upfront:
```
"Create this using only React built-in hooks (no external state management), 
Tailwind utility classes only, and ensure TypeScript strict mode compatibility."
```

#### 4. **Example-Driven Development**
Provided concrete examples of expected behavior:
```
"When user clicks thumbs up, the button should change from gray to green with 
border highlight, toggle off if clicked again, and show 'Thanks for feedback' message."
```

### Strategic AI Usage Breakdown

**Where AI Accelerated Development:**
- **Boilerplate Generation**: TypeScript interfaces, component structure
- **Tailwind Utility Discovery**: Finding optimal class combinations for complex layouts
- **Icon Integration**: Quickly identifying available Lucide React icons
- **Responsive Design**: Grid and flexbox patterns for different screen sizes

**Where I Maintained Full Control:**
- **Architecture Decisions**: Component structure, state management strategy
- **Business Logic**: Search flow, feedback handling, error management
- **UX/UI Design**: User experience flow, interaction patterns
- **Performance Considerations**: Re-render optimization, state organization

### AI Assistant Rules & Templates Strategy

For larger projects, I would implement systematic rules and templates to ensure consistency and quality:

#### Example Rule Set for Enterprise React Projects:

```typescript
// .cursor-rules or similar AI configuration
{
  "react_component_template": {
    "structure": {
      "imports": "React hooks first, then external libraries, then internal modules",
      "interfaces": "Define all TypeScript interfaces before component",
      "component": "Named export with descriptive name",
      "hooks": "Custom hooks at component top, built-in hooks follow",
      "handlers": "Event handlers prefixed with 'handle'",
      "rendering": "Early returns for loading/error states before main JSX"
    },
    "naming_conventions": {
      "components": "PascalCase with descriptive names",
      "hooks": "camelCase starting with 'use'",
      "handlers": "handleActionName pattern",
      "constants": "SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE",
      "types": "PascalCase with 'Type' or 'Interface' suffix"
    },
    "required_patterns": {
      "error_handling": "Every API call must have try-catch with user-friendly error states",
      "loading_states": "All async operations must show loading indicators",
      "accessibility": "All interactive elements need proper ARIA labels",
      "responsive": "All components must work on mobile and desktop"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Concrete Template Example:

**Search Component Template Rule:**
```
When creating search-related components, always include:

1. **State Management Pattern:**
   - query: string for input
   - loading: boolean for async states  
   - error: string for error messages
   - results: typed array for search results

2. **API Integration Pattern:**
   - Separate async function for API calls
   - Comprehensive error handling with user messaging
   - Loading state management throughout request lifecycle

3. **UX Requirements:**
   - Debounced search input (300ms minimum)
   - Empty state messaging
   - Loading indicators during searches
   - Clear error states with retry options

4. **TypeScript Requirements:**
   - Strict interfaces for all API responses
   - Proper typing for all event handlers
   - No 'any' types allowed

Example prompt: "Create a search component following our search template rules..."
```

### Advanced Prompt Techniques Used

#### 1. **Role-Based Prompting**
```
"Acting as a senior React developer reviewing code for production deployment, 
help me optimize this component for performance and maintainability..."
```

#### 2. **Constraint Chaining**
```
"Create a feedback system that: 1) Uses only emoji (no external icons), 
2) Stores state in React (no localStorage), 3) Provides visual feedback, 
4) Can be easily extended to save to backend API"
```

#### 3. **Context Preservation**
Maintained conversation context by referencing previous code:
```
"Based on the SearchQuery interface we defined earlier, update the feedback 
function to handle the queryId properly..."
```

### Team Scaling Strategy

For larger development teams, I would implement:

#### 1. **Standardized Prompt Libraries**
```typescript
// prompts/react-component.md
## React Component Creation Prompt
Create a React TypeScript component with the following requirements:
- Component Name: [COMPONENT_NAME]
- Props Interface: [PROPS_DESCRIPTION]  
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with our design system tokens
- State Management: React hooks only, no external libraries
- Error Handling: Comprehensive try-catch with user-friendly messages
- Testing: Include basic Jest test structure
- Documentation: JSDoc comments for all public methods
```

#### 2. **Code Review AI Rules**
```
When reviewing React code, check for:
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Proper hook dependency arrays
- Accessibility attributes on interactive elements
- Error boundary compatibility
- Performance optimization (memo, callback, effect cleanup)
- Consistent naming conventions
```

#### 3. **Automated Template Generation**
```
For API integration components, always generate:
1. TypeScript interfaces matching backend schema
2. Custom hook for API calls with error handling
3. Loading and error state components
4. Unit tests for happy path and error cases
5. Storybook stories for component documentation
```

### Lessons Learned

**Most Effective Prompting Strategies:**
1. **Front-load Context**: Provide comprehensive background in initial prompt
2. **Specify Non-Requirements**: Clearly state what NOT to include
3. **Request Explanations**: Ask AI to explain its approach for learning
4. **Iterate Incrementally**: Build complexity through multiple focused prompts

**AI Limitations Encountered:**
- Icon library availability (required manual verification)
- Complex state management decisions (needed human architectural thinking)
- UX flow optimization (required user empathy and experience)
- Performance edge cases (needed domain expertise)

This balanced approach allowed me to leverage AI for productivity gains while maintaining full ownership of critical technical decisions and ensuring the solution met professional development standards.
